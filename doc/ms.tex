%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.
\documentclass[a4paper,fleqn,usenatbib]{mnras}

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX
% installations will be fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment
% out the following line
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{ae,aecompl}

\section{Introduction}


\section{Hypothesis Space}
Our modelling assumptions are intended as a compromize between flexibility
(so we can potentially infer complex structures) and computational
tractability.

Consider a coordinate system $(x,y)$ in units of the star's radius.
The surface brightness profile
$S(x, y)$ of the star uses the limb darkening profile
\begin{align}
S(x, y; b) &=
    \left\{
        \begin{array}{lr}
            1 - b\left(1 - \sqrt{1 - (x^2 + y^2)}\right),   & x^2+y^2 \leq 1\\
            0, & \textnormal{otherwise}
        \end{array}
    \right.
\end{align}
where $b$ is a limb darkening parameter.

The density profile of the obscuring material is composed of a sum of
$N$ circular ``blobs'' based on the blob profile
used by \citet{lensing2}. A single blob of width $w$ and total ``mass'' $M$
(the integral of the density profile),
positioned at the origin, would have density profile
\begin{align}
\rho(x, y) &= \left\{
        \begin{array}{lr}
            \frac{2M}{\pi w^2}\left(1 - \frac{r^2}{w^2}\right), & r \leq w\\
            0, & \textnormal{otherwise}
        \end{array}\right.
\end{align}
where $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. The total density profile of $N$ blobs,
with masses $\{M_i\}$ and centers $\{(x_i, y_i)\}$, is
\begin{align}
\rho(x, y) &= \sum_{i=1}^N
        \left\{
        \begin{array}{lr}
            \frac{2M_i}{\pi w_i^2}
                \left(1 - \frac{r_i^2}{w_i^2}\right), & r_i \leq w_i\\
            0, & \textnormal{otherwise}
        \end{array}\right.
\end{align}
where $r_i = \sqrt{(x - x_i)^2 + (y - y_i)^2}$ is the distance of a point
in the $x-y$ plane from the central position $(x_i, y_i)$ of blob $i$.
